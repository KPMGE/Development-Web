                         pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete 
                         account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great 
                         explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No 
                         one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pl
                         easure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rati
                         onally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again i
                         s there anyone who loves or <em>pursues</em> or desires to obtain pain of itself,
                        because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which 
                        toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
                         which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain s
                        ome advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who cho
                        oses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a p
                        ain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
